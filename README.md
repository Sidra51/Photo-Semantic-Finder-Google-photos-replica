# Photo-Semantic-Finder---Google-photos-replica
 "Photo Semantic Finder: Replicate Google Photos' aiming to replicate its functionality of searching images using natural language queries. With this application, users can upload their images and search for them using descriptive captions such as "car", "child playing", or "birthdays".

## How it works

1. **Upload Images**: Users can upload their images through the web interface.
  
2. **Caption Generation**: The uploaded images are passed through the BLIP Image Captioning model to generate descriptive captions.
  
3. **Search by Caption**: Users can search for images using natural language queries. The application retrieves images whose captions match the query.
